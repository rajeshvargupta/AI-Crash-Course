        "\n",
        "1. **Linear relationship**\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the most important assumptions is that a linear relationship is said to exist between the dependent and the independent variables. If you try to fit a linear relationship in a non-linear data set, the proposed algorithm won’t capture the trend as a linear graph, resulting in an inefficient model. Thus, it would result in inaccurate predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**How can you determine if the assumption is met?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The simple way to determine if this assumption is met or not is by creating a scatter plot x vs y. If the data points fall on a straight line in the graph, there is a linear relationship between the dependent and the independent variables, and the assumption holds.\n",
        "\n",
        "![](https://i.imgur.com/XmytW3M.jpg)\n",
        "\n",
        "**What should you do if this assumption is violated?**\n",
        "\n",
        "If a linear relationship doesn’t exist between the dependent and the independent variables, then apply a non-linear transformation such as logarithmic, exponential, square root, or reciprocal either to the dependent variable, independent variable, or both.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Little or No autocorrelation in the residuals**\n",
        "\n",
        "Autocorrelation occurs when the residual errors are dependent on each other.The presence of correlation in error terms drastically reduces model’s accuracy.This usually occurs in time series models where the next instant is dependent on previous instant.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How to determine if the assumption is met?**\n",
        "Autocorrelation can be tested with the help of **Durbin-Watson test**.The null hypothesis of the test is that there is no serial correlation. The Durbin-Watson test statistics is defined as:\n",
        "![](https://i.imgur.com/eJwDh2F.jpg)\n",
        "\n",
        "The test statistic is approximately equal to 2*(1-r) where r is the sample autocorrelation of the residuals. Thus, for r == 0, indicating no serial correlation, the test statistic equals 2. This statistic will always be between 0 and 4. The closer to 0 the statistic, the more evidence for positive serial correlation. The closer to 4, the more evidence for negative serial correlation.\n",

        "* For seasonal correlation, consider adding a few seasonal variables to the model.\n",

If the data points are spread across equally without a prominent pattern, it means the residuals have constant variance (homoscedasticity).

        "Training data helps these models learn over time, and the cost function within gradient descent specifically acts as a barometer, gauging its accuracy with each iteration of parameter updates. Until the function is close to or equal to zero, the model will continue to adjust its parameters to yield the smallest possible error. Once machine learning models are optimized for accuracy, they can be powerful tools for artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science applications.\n",

        "You may also recall plotting a scatterplot in statistics and finding the line of best fit, which required calculating the error between the actual output and the predicted output $(\\hat{y})$ using the mean squared error formula.

        "The starting point is just an arbitrary point for us to evaluate the performance. From that starting point, we will find the derivative (or slope), and from there, we can use a tangent line to observe the steepness of the slope. The slope will inform the updates to the parameters—i.e. the weights and bias. The slope at the starting point will be steeper, but as new parameters are generated, the steepness should gradually reduce until it reaches the lowest point on the curve, known as the point of convergence.   \n",
        "\n",
        "Similar to finding the line of best fit in linear regression, the goal of gradient descent is to minimize the cost function, or the error between predicted and actual y. In order to do this, it requires two data points—a direction and a learning rate. These factors determine the partial derivative calculations of future iterations, allowing it to gradually arrive at the local or global minimum (i.e. point of convergence).\n",

Conversely, a low learning rate has small step sizes. While it has the advantage of more precision, the number of iterations compromises overall efficiency as this takes more time and computations to reach the minimum.\n",

Hence, the parameters are being updated even after one iteration in which only a single example has been processed. Hence this is quite faster than batch gradient descent. But again, when the number of training examples is large, even then it processes only one example which can be additional overhead for the system as the number of iterations will be quite large.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Mini Batch gradient descent: This is a type of gradient descent which works faster than both batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent. Here b examples where `b<m` are processed per iteration. So even if the number of training examples is large, it is processed in batches of b training examples in one go. Thus, it works for larger training examples and that too with lesser number of iterations."
